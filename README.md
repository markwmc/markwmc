  <summary><h3>My Dev Journey</h3></summary>

  9/5/2025 I Learned about the WARN Act and how quickly companies can move from acquisition and "discussing employee integration" to deciding to rm -rf /github.com/${aquiredCompany} due to "redundancy". I anticipated this would happen and started working through and following the plan in [Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview](https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/part-i-preface/what-is-this-book). 
  
  Well. 2 years already. I'm finally getting the hang of this. and by this I mean the constant change, constant pivoting, constant switching from starting new projects and features, throwing all the work away, actually creating new products and features, to debugging legacy systems in the same sprint. I owe it all to my mentors, my work ethic, and an intelligent use of ChatGPT. This year I am going to  be working on moving into the blockchain space. 

Although I'm using dozens of tools and a few languages and frameworks; I believe my greatest skill that I've developed is patience. I am not a frameworker, I am not a React Developer, I may be something similar to a Systems Developer; but most importanly I am someone that utilizes whatever tools and languages necessary to solve simple and complex problems, and I'm confident enough to take on these problems even thought I may not have prior experience with them. 
  
  Starting out in the GIS field there were a lot of out of the box tools and features.
I never believed I would need dev experience until about 5 years ago. The concept of
learning programming was terrifying, and even though I had taken some college courses
and dabbled with various free coding sites, I put off diving in until Jan 2023. The
catalysts were automation and survival. The company I worked with had contracted out
a lot of my work to a SaaS. My job became much easier - basically reviewing the work of the Saas,
 and I quickly realized that the entire project could be automated. My time was limited.
Additionally, my career progression had hit a wall. With no programming skills; I was becoming obsolete. 
So, I left my job, took out personal loans, and learned as much as I could as fast as I could from anyone who would give
me the time. Since then I've fully immersed myself in all things tech. Leaving no stones unturned. I'm just starting out,
but I am using my life experience to facilitate the process.

  I had to break through so many assumptions and limiting beliefs to get to this point. Now that I am here, my whole perspective of the physical and virtual world has changed. I can never go back, nor do I want to. What started out as a desperate attempt to stay valuable has turned into a quest for something. I'm not quite sure where this will lead. 
  
  What surprised me the most about development is the creativity required. It's one thing to start a small app project and maintain it on a github repo. Learning multiple codebases in JavaScript with multiple JS libraries and dependencies, then writing a Go middleware program to interface with it and external apis to send request bodies that contain patient data to redirects and sign in pages is a whole new level of abstraction that I've never encountered before.

  The next surprise was the complexity of CI/CD. With different environments, to Docker, Kubernetes, Artifactory, Jenkins, just to name a few, has forced me to upskill at an incredible pace. I am learning how to focus on the bare minimum needed to accomplish the task, then go back on my own time to build a better foundation. 

 I have also learned just how vulnerable everything is. Coming from a military background I have learned just how vulnerable our physical world is, as well as our country, and now I have a better understanding of cybersecurity as well.

  While I don't have a preference where I work/ what I learn for now; on my own time I'm interested in learning robotics, ML/LLM, and how we can utilize those for physical security, and space exploration/mining/habitation.
